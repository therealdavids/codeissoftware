#### Don't buy into the hype and take a step back.

<div class="philosophy-dialogue">

It's 2:11 in the morning and you're trying to jam out this feature and it hasn't been working out. 

<span class="bubble you">
    "What if I try this? What if I use this heuristic instead?"
</span>

It's now 4:21 and you're burnt out. You've been going through tutorials and [ExpertsExchange](https://stackoverflow.com/) threads trying to figure out what in the world is going on. 

You finally collapse onto your bed, defeated.

When you finally wake up, you meet with your buddy at the local cafe. Upon sitting down, you bust out your laptop and vigourously gesture at your app.

<span class="bubble you">
    "How would you solve it? I've been literally losing sleep over this!"
</span>

They sip their latte and reply:

<span class="bubble them">
    "Just do X. It'll work just fine."
</span>

You do X. It works perfectly and with no fuss!

<span class="bubble you">
    "How did you figure that out so quickly!?"
</span>

Annoyed, they gesture at errant tab in your browser.

<span class="bubble them">
    "Look here, it says in the docs. I've also seen this before in another framework. [Veggie](https://vuejs.org) isn't all that groudbreaking. Like [Rubarb](https://reactjs.org), it has some crossover [Arugula](https://angular.io)."
</span>

Puzzled, you reflect on what they said. 

<span class="bubble you">
    "You actually read those things? Doesn't that take too long?"
</span>

They retort.

<span class="bubble them">
    "Not that long. It's a lot easier than going through a wild goose chase on [Bing](https://bing.com)."
</span>

<span class="bubble you">
    "But I read about it on [Huckster News!](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/) Everyone is talking abo&mdash;"
</span>

<span class="bubble them">
    "I mean, I solved it faster than you did right?"
</span>

They continue.

<span class="bubble them">
    "Just because something's the <b>new hotness</b>&trade; doesn't mean it's good, right? Anyone can start a new framework right now, and it can blow up."
</span>

<span class="bubble you">
    "But how will I learn about new frameworks? How will I know what to use for new projects? How do I know what's <i>right</i>?"
</span>

<span class="bubble them">
    "Take a step back and don't buy into the hype. Slow down. Read the docs and maybe do a little proof of concept to prove it out."
    <br/><br/>
    It takes a while, but it's something you'd want do regularly."
</span>

You pause.

<span class="bubble you">
    "Isn't there a better way to do this? They're so many new things created every day. I have a galaxy's worth of stars On GitHub. How do you keep up with this?"
</span>

<span class="bubble them">
    "Well, don't learn frameworks or libraries, learn how they work. After a while, you'll start seeing through it all. You'll develop an intuition and then you'll stop thinking about it."
</span>

<span class="bubble you">
    "That's a lot to think about."
</span>

<span class="bubble them">
    "Don't use your head, use your heart."
</span>

You ponder what they say.

<span class="bubble you">
    "My head hurts, what do you mean?"
</span>

<span class="bubble them">
    "Exactly."
</span>
